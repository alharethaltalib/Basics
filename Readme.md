### 1. Create a new console application.
### 2. Print all numbers from 1 to 100 to the console, in ascending order.
### 3. Print all numbers from 1 to 100 to the console in descending order.
### 4. Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n
Write a method *Sum* as follows
``` C#
1 public static int Sum (int n)
2 {
3 // TODO ...
4 }
```
that computes <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i}," target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i}," title="\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i}," /></a> the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.
Note: Overflow does not need to be taken into account.
### 5.Program two alternative versions of sum
There are several ways to implement the method described in the previous question.
Write two differing implementations
```c#
1 public static int Sum_A ( int n)
2 {
3 // TODO ...
4 }
5
6 public static int Sum_B ( int n)
7 {
8 // TODO ...
9 }
```
with the same functionality, but using different language features. You should choose a
total of 3 from the following:
* Implementation using a for-loop.
* Implementation using a while-loop.
* Implementation using LINQ.
* Implementation that runs in constant time O(1).
